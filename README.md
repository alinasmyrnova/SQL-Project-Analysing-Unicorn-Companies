# SQL Project: Analyzing Unicorn Companies

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing trends among high-growth companies, commonly known as "unicorns." The main goal is to understand which industries generate the highest valuations and how frequently new billion-dollar startups emerge.  

## Data Source  
The database used in this project is from **DataCamp** and is available in **PostgreSQL**. It is called **"unicorns"** and contains data on unicorn companies up to the year **2021**.
You can access the dataset and explore it using **DataCamp's DataLab**:

### What is a Unicorn Company?  
A **unicorn company** is a privately held startup with a valuation exceeding **$1 billion**. These companies are often backed by venture capital and operate in various industries.  

### Database Structure  
The **unicorns** database consists of multiple tables, providing insights into different aspects of high-growth startups:

## Data_Analysis
### What companies have the biggest return on investment? 
```sql
-- Finding top 10 companies with the highest ROI
SELECT 
    c.company, 
	c.country,
	i.industry,
    f.valuation, 
    f.funding, 
    ROUND((f.valuation - f.funding) / NULLIF(f.funding, 0), 2) AS ROI  
FROM funding AS f
JOIN companies AS c USING (company_id)
JOIN industries AS i USING (company_id)
WHERE f.valuation IS NOT NULL AND f.funding > 0 -- Exclude companies with missing data
ORDER BY ROI DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

### Which countries produce the most unicorns?  Which cities are unicorn hubs?
```sql
-- Finding the number of unicorns per country
SELECT country, 
       COUNT(company_id) AS num_unicorns 
FROM companies 
GROUP BY country  
ORDER BY num_unicorns DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

```sql
-- Finding the number of unicorns per city (Unicorn hubs)
SELECT c.city, c.country,  
       COUNT(c.company_id) AS num_unicorns  
FROM companies AS c  
GROUP BY c.city, c.country  
ORDER BY num_unicorns DESC  
LIMIT 10;
```

## How long does it take for startups in different industries to become unicorns?
```sql
-- Calculate the average time (in years) from founding to unicorn status per industry
SELECT i.industry,  
       ROUND(AVG(EXTRACT(YEAR FROM d.date_joined) - d.year_founded)::numeric, 2) AS avg_time_to_unicorn_years  
FROM industries AS i  
JOIN dates AS d USING (company_id)  
WHERE EXTRACT(year FROM d.date_joined) IS NOT NULL  
GROUP BY i.industry  
ORDER BY avg_time_to_unicorn_years ASC;
```

## What is the average growth rate per industry for last 5 years?
```sql
-- Calculate the average growth rate per industry for last 5 years (2017-2021)
WITH unicorn_counts AS (
    -- Count the number of unicorns per industry per year for 2017-2021

    SELECT industry,
           year,

           LAG(num_unicorns) OVER (PARTITION BY industry ORDER BY year) AS prev_year_unicorns,
           CASE 
               WHEN LAG(num_unicorns) OVER (PARTITION BY industry ORDER BY year) > 0
               THEN (num_unicorns - LAG(num_unicorns) OVER (PARTITION BY industry ORDER BY year)) * 100.0 / LAG(num_unicorns) OVER (PARTITION BY industry ORDER BY year)
               ELSE NULL
           END AS growth_rate
    FROM unicorn_counts
